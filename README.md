# PHP script for coverting Number to Words in Myanmar Language

<p>This github repository aimed to help for those who are required to
translate numeric data (written either in English or Unicode in Burmese) into spoken Burmese language
phrases. The utility function simply take numerical value as the parameter and return the converted phrase.
It has been trouble for many of those who are required to program number written in English into spoken
Burmese phases previously and thus motivated to contribute this code snippet on github.
